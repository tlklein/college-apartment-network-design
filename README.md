# Network Design
## CIS 3347

This design is meant to be the best possible scenario for a college apartment network, for it to give high speed and reliable performance for as many students, staff, and guests as possible. 
It was made to function like a hotel-type network where hospitality would be important over costeffectiveness because of the luxury nature of the apartments.  
This network design will mostly follow the Cisco Hybrid Campus LAN Design Guide and other field deployment guides seen on the Cisco website.  
All my recommendations for both network devices and accessories will be included in the total cost of the network design section. 
The diagram will be a general guide to my network design, including the placement of the access points, switches, routers, and ethernet cables. 
It is not meant to be a very detailed diagram only a rough summary.  
The general notation used for the IP subnets will follow the recommendations set out by IPCISCO (IPCISCO, 2022).
