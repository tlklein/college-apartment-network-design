# College Apartment Network Design Project

This repository contains a comprehensive network design project created by a university student studying Computer Information Systems (CIS). 
The project focuses on building a robust, high-performance network for a luxury college apartment, balancing hospitality, reliability, and scalability.

## Project Overview

The network design simulates a hotel-style network setup catering to students, staff, and guests. The design incorporates:

- **High-Speed Wired and Wireless Access**: Optimized for multimedia services, online learning, and gaming.
- **Scalability**: Ability to support thousands of concurrent users.
- **Advanced Monitoring and Security**: Leveraging Cisco Meraki solutions for cloud-based visibility and secure SD-WAN.

## Features

- **Layered Network Design**:
  - Layer 2 and Layer 3 access designs for efficient routing and failover.
  - VLAN segmentation for secure, flexible network management.
- **Hardware and Software Recommendations**:
  - Devices like MX250 routers, C9300/C9500 switches, and MR53/MR30H access points.
  - Cloud-based management with licenses tailored for the deployment.
- **Optimized Wi-Fi Channels**:
  - Channels 1, 6, and 11 for minimal interference and maximum performance.
- **Total Cost Analysis**:
  - Comprehensive breakdown of hardware, licenses, and accessories.

## Project Structure
1. **File name:** Klein_Trinity_16667_Network Design
- Documentation and report covering network design and diagrams
2. **File name:** Klein_Trinity_16667-FinalProject - FloorPLan
- Visio document of network diagrams

## Getting Started

1. **Requirements**:
   - Familiarity with Cisco network configurations.
   - Basic understanding of subnetting and VLAN setup.
2. **Usage**:
   - Review the document for an explanation of all networking recommendations.
   - Review the Visio document to view the network design diagram for the multiple floors and amenities.

## About the Author

This project was created as part of the **CIS 3347 Network Design** Course at the University of Houston under the guidance of Professor Jose Martinez. 
The primary focus was to apply real-world network design principles in a controlled academic setting.
